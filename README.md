Jot is an app that serves as a lecture notes sharing platform. Using Google Firebase for User Authentication, Database and Storage, each user creates their profile and adds classes from the Cornell roster, sharing their "Jots" for specific classes.

Note at that the moment there are some bugs when it comes to displaying the array of images for Jots with multiple images.
